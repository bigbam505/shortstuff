It is designed for use inside a closed network where an admin can control the DNS server so you can make your own url service. It does not offer any authentication (this is by design) and URLs are never expired. There is a very simple JSON api for creating new URLs. I may release a CLI gem that interfaces with this via some kind of ENV configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development Setup\r\n\r\nGet the code.\r\n\r\n    git clone git@github.com:drapergeek/shortstuff.git\r\n\r\nSet up the project's dependencies.\r\n\r\n    cd project\r\n    bundle --binstubs\r\n\r\nThis will automatically add a heroku remote for staging.\r\n\r\nRunning tests:\r\n\r\n    rspec spec\r\n\r\n\r\nUse [Foreman](http://goo.gl/oy4uw) to run the app locally.\r\n\r\n    foreman start\r\n\r\nIt uses your `.env` file and `Procfile` to run processes just like Heroku's\r\n[Cedar](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar/) stack.","google":"","tagline":""}
